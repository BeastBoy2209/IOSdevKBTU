# Superhero Randomizer App

## Objective

Create an iOS application that fetches and displays random superhero information from the SuperHero API.  
This project will help you understand networking in iOS, JSON parsing, and UI design.

---

## Project Description

Your task is to develop an app that:

- Fetches a random superhero when a button is tapped.
- Displays detailed information about the superhero, using **at least 10 attributes** from the API response.
- Provides a user-friendly interface that is visually appealing and easy to navigate.

---

## 1. Networking

- Use `URLSession` to make network requests.
- Fetch data from the SuperHero API:  
  <https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/>
- Ensure proper error handling for network requests.

---

## 2. Random Superhero Functionality

- Implement a **“Randomize”** button that fetches and displays a random superhero each time it’s tapped.
- Ensure randomness by selecting from the full list of superheroes provided by the API.

---

## 3. Display Superhero Information

Display **at least 10 attributes** from the superhero’s data, for example:

- Name  
- Full Name  
- Intelligence  
- Strength  
- Speed  
- Image  
- (and other attributes from the API response)

You **must** include the superhero’s **image** in the display.

---

## 4. User Interface

- Design a clean and intuitive UI using **UIKit**.
- Use **Auto Layout** to ensure the app looks good on all device sizes and orientations.

---

## 5. Code Quality

- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Follow Swift coding conventions and best practices.

---

## 6. Error Handling

- Gracefully handle errors such as:
  - Failed network requests
  - JSON parsing errors
- Provide clear user feedback in case of errors (e.g., alerts, placeholders, messages).

---

## 7. Bonus (Optional)

- Add **animations** when transitioning between superheroes (e.g., fade, slide, or scale animations).

---

## 8. Submission Guidelines

- Submit your complete Xcode project in your **Git repository**.
- Include a **video demonstration** of your project.
- Ensure all assets and dependencies are included, and the project **builds successfully**.

---

## 9. Tips

- **Start Early**: Give yourself plenty of time to work through challenges.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Regularly test your app on different devices or simulators.
- **Ask Questions**: If you’re unsure about any aspect of the assignment, don’t hesitate to reach out.

## 10. Academic Integrity

This assignment must be completed **individually**.  
Plagiarism or copying code from others is strictly prohibited and will result in a **failing grade**.
